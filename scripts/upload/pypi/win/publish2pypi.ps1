# This script is used to build and upload a Python package to PyPI.
# It assumes that the package has already been built and is located in the dist directory.
# It also assumes that the dev-requirements.txt file is located in the same directory as the script.
# It also assumes that the Tsinghua University PyPI mirror is used.

# To use this script, you need to have Python installed on your system and have pip installed.
# You also need to have the twine package installed, which you can install by running the following command:
# pip install twine

# To run the script, simply execute the following command in PowerShell:

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Force

# Install the required packages and build the package

# If you want to upload to the official PyPI repository, use the following command instead:
twine upload dist/*
# If you want to upload to the test PyPI repository, use the following command instead:
#twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
